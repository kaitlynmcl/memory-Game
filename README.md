# Remember Coffee
This is a memory game that was built with React. The goal of the game is to achieve the top score by selecting every image once. If you choose an image twice, the game will reset to zero.

To run the game locally, download the repository and run it in your terminal. By visiting localhost:3000, you will be able to play the game!

For more detailed instructions, enter the remembercoffee folder!
